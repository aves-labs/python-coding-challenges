# Python Coding Challenges

A collection of Python solutions to various coding problems and algorithms.

## What This Is

This repository contains my implementations of coding challenges I've encountered. Each folder represents a different problem with its solution and related files.

## How to Navigate

- **Browse folders** - Each challenge is in its own directory
- **Check individual READMEs** - Each folder has its own documentation
- **Run solutions** - Python files are executable and contain the implementations

## Folder Structure
/challenge-name/
│
├── solution.py # The working code
├── problem.md # What problem is being solved
└── solution_manual.md # How to use and understand the solution #Note: Not each folder has solution_manual.md

## Why I even created this

- To document my problem-solving approach
- To have a reference for similar problems
- To demonstrate practical Python programming
- To track my learning progress

*Simple solutions to interesting problems.*
